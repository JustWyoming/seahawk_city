We are all 12.

###Description:
Seahawk City was a group project with colleagues at General Assembly. The app itself is a simple Geo-caching game. The concept involved invoking the spirit and viral appeal of the 12th man for a checkin style game. Users see 12th Man flags or icons around town, take a picture, login and post their location and image. Other users can choose to locate flags nearby, or add their own photo of a new flag or image. We initially wanted to have a B-2-C component for businesses to be able to checkin and create locations/events for Seahawks related promotions, and built in the preliminary feature for this.

###Challenges:
Time management of our team was tricky. In retrospect, we would approach this process with daily meetings using Agile workflow.  We had a lot more de-bugging than we budgeted for, which made it necessary to sacrifice some features we would have liked to implement. 

###Wishlist:
Building out more of the 'hooks' to keep users engaged, such as the B-2-C component and further gamification, more calls to action for both fans and consumers, such as badges that go towards incentives for businesses, and expanded profile options, as well as a feature for sharing items across other social media outlets.

###Tools:
GitHub, Ruby on Rails, Sequelize, Google Maps, Cloudinary API, jQuery, Ajax, Bootstrap.
